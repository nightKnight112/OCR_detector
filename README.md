# Object_Detector_CV
A Object detector which identifies the classes of the objects in an image or a video


## NOTES

1. Video OCR done in seperate file Video_OCR_part.py, and it also accepts webcam feeds
2. Both video and image part is dynamic, we only have to provide the correct path location for our image/video
3. Screencapture captures the entire screen by default, can also be used to capture a specific ROI and use OCR there
4. Screencapture part also records the screen capture and saves it as screen_cap_rcrd_final.avi in the project dir, which can be used for reevalution laten on
